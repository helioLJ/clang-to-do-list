# To-Do List Application:
## Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple command-line to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application should provide functionalities to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, and view the list of tasks.

## Requirements

1. User Interface:
    - The application should have a simple command-line interface.
    - Upon launching the application, users should be presented with a menu of options.
2. Functionality:
    - Add Task: Users should be able to add tasks to the to-do list. - - Each task should have a unique identifier and a description.
    - Mark Task as Complete: Users should be able to mark tasks as complete. Completed tasks should be distinguishable from incomplete tasks.
    - Delete Task: Users should be able to delete tasks from the to-do list.
    - View To-Do List: Users should be able to view the list of tasks, including both incomplete and completed tasks.
3. Data Storage:
    - Tasks should be stored persistently in a file to ensure that they are not lost when the application is closed.
    - Use basic file I/O operations to read and write tasks to a text file.
4. Error Handling:
    - The application should handle errors gracefully. For example, display appropriate error messages if a file cannot be opened or if an invalid input is provided by the user.
5. Code Structure:
    - Implement modular code with appropriate functions for adding, marking, deleting, and viewing tasks.
    - Use separate header and source files to organize the code.
5. User Input Handling:
    - Validate user input to ensure that only valid options are accepted.
    - Provide clear instructions and prompts for user interactions.

## Roadmap
1. Project Setup:

- Set up the project structure with separate directories for source files, header files, and any additional resources.
- Initialize a git repository for version control.

2. User Interface Implementation:

- Implement the command-line interface with a menu of options.
- Display appropriate prompts and messages for user interactions.

3. Task Management:

- Implement functions for adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks, and viewing the to-do list.
- Ensure that tasks are stored persistently in a text file.

4. Error Handling:

- Implement error handling mechanisms to handle file I/O errors and invalid user input.

5. Testing and Debugging:

- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.
- Debug any issues that arise during testing.

6. Documentation:

- Write documentation for the code, including comments within the source code and a README file with instructions for building and using the application.

Deliverables:

- Source code files (*.c, *.h)
- README.md file with instructions for building and running the application
- Documentation explaining the code structure, functionalities, and usage instructions

### Submission Deadline: [15/04/2024]
